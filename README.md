# Day Scheduler

This day scheduler allows you to add tasks that need to get done throughout your day. The current hour is displayed red, future is green, and past is gray. The current date is displayed on the top of the screen. The save button next to the task input area saves your task to local storage. This allows you to see your page even after you refresh it.

## Collaboration
I worked on this entire project with my wife, Carly Staheli. I don't have as many git commits because we worked on the project using her laptop displayed on our TV.
